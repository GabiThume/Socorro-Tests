Socorro Tests
===================

Automated tests for the Socorro web application.

Running Tests
-------------

### Java
You will need a version of the [Java Runtime Environment][JRE] installed

[JRE]: http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html

### Python
Before you're able to run these tests, you'll need to have Python 2.6 installed.

Run:

    easy_install pip

followed by:

    sudo pip install -r requirements.txt

__note__

If you are running on Ubuntu/Debian, you will need to first do:

    sudo apt-get install python-setuptools

to install the required Python libraries.

### Selenium
Once this is all set up, you will need to download and start a Selenium server. You can download the latest Selenium server from [here][Selenium Downloads]. The filename will be something like 'selenium-server-standalone-2.x.x.jar',
where "2.x.x" is the latest shipping version #.

To start the Selenium server run the following command:

    java -jar ~/Downloads/selenium-server-standalone-2.x.x.jar

Change the path/name to the downloaded Selenium-server file.

[Selenium Downloads]: http://code.google.com/p/selenium/downloads/list

### Running tests locally

1. To run tests locally, simply call py.test from the Socorro-tests directory
2. The base URL should be a valid instance of crash-stats-dev: --baseurl=http://crash-stats-dev.allizom.org
3. The browser name you desire to test on: --browsername=Firefox
4. The platform where you are testing: --platform=Linux

    py.test --baseurl=http://example.com --browsername=desired_browser_name --platform=your_platform

For other instructions, type py.test --help.
